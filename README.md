MvcBootstrap Example App
============

This repository contains an example app for using [MvcBootstrap](https://github.com/carlgieringer/MvcBootstrap).  The 
solution contains three projects, Domain (DDD project for classes that will be entities in the application), Data
(Entity Framework DbContext, Entity Framework configuration, and Repositories), and Web (ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Application.)
The solution also contains a growing number of tests demonstrating the use of the framework, Test-Driven Design, and
also just some helpful test patterns (e.g., testing whether all Bundled files exist and whether any explicitly included
files are ignored by Bundle optimization.)
